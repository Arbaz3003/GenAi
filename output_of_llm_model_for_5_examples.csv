2. RAM usage variability: The RAM usage varies significantly throughout the month, with the highest usage on 222-8-14 (46.371%) and the lowest on 222-8-31 (29.112%). This suggests that the user's activities and applications used on the computer differ greatly in terms of memory consumption.

3. Missing disk IO usage data: The disk IO usage data is missing (NaN) for all the entries in the table. This information is crucial for understanding the overall performance and resource utilization of the computer. It is recommended to investigate the reason for the missing data and ensure that it is collected in the future.","
